Notation
Instructions
You are managing a library system where books and movies are stored in a 2D
array, with each row representing a shelf, and each column representing an item
on that shelf.
Tasks
Make sure to write the code for each task using only bracket notation.
Task 1: Create a multi-dimensional array with nine books and/or movies of your
choice.
Task 2: Access and log all the elements in the array using bracket notation with
numbers.
Task 3: Access and log all the elements in the array using bracket notation with
variables as indices. Use the variables row and item.
